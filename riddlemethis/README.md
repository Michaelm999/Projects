# Riddle Me This

![riddle](Logomakr_8kV080.png)

## Hi there! Welcome to my Riddle Challenge! Try to take it on, if you dare!

Each player takes on a series of brain teasers designed to test players critical thinking logic skills. It is multiple choice, but it's up to you to figure out which choice is correct. But before you decide to just push every button until you guess right, you should know how the game is scored:

+ Getting a riddle right grants you 2 points.
+ If you guess wrong, you lose 1 point. In addition, you can't move on to the next riddle until you get the current one right.  

After one player plays through, Player 2 gets the chance to try and solve these riddles. Both players scores will be displayed at the end.
